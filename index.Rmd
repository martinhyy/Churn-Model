## What is Churn Prediction
<br>
> - # Survival Analysis
     - First used in clinical trials and the event of interest was dead or alive.

> - # Now it is widely used to predict the probability of occurrence of an event.
     - In a dataset   
        - 1: an event occurred
        - 0: an event didn't occur

---

## The purpose of Churner Prediction
<br>
> - # Find people who are likely to churn


> - # Try to find a way to interact with them and keep them on board

---

## The process of Churn Prediction
<br>
> - # Choose historical data
> - # Build model based on historical data
     - Significant variables and their weight (coefficient) can be picked out.
    
> - # Apply the coefficient (weight) of variables on our current active members and get probability
> - # Pick up the first 1000 people with lowest probability

*** =left

>  Categorical Data  

   - Gift Status (1, 0)
   - Gender

## Model Prediction
<br>
# Changing character/text variables into factors

> - # Values in `Current_Status`, `Gender`, `Assigned_Fundraiser` and all other categorical variables should be changed into numbers
       - `Active`, `Terminated` will become 1, 0
       - `Female`, `Male`, `Unknown` will become 1, 2, 3
       - `Telefundraiser`, `Canvasser`, `Frontliner`, `WEB`, `Saver` will become 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
<br>

> - # The numbers here are not really numeric. It only tells the programme which is first category, second category and etc.

## Model Prediction
<br>
# Logistic regression is used. It deals with scenarios with 2 outcomes.

<br>
Logistic regression is part of <font color="red">G</font>eneralized <font color="red">L</font>inear <font color="red">M</font>odel (`GLM`) family

The syntax of a `logistic` regression will be like the script below

```{r warning=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
my_model <- glm(Status.Indicator ~ Age + Gender + Income + Assigned_Fundraier + ..., 
                data = df,
                family = binomial(logit))

```

## Model Prediction

- Logistic regression gives us the coefficients of all variables that are included in the model.

*** =left

```{r warning=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
my_model <- glm(Status.Indicator ~ Age 
                 + Gender 
                 + Income
                 + Assigned_Fundraiser 
                 + Sign_Up_Amount 
                 + Frequency 
                 + First_Gift_Amount 
                 + Last_Gift_Amount 
                 #+ Saved 
                 #+ Upgrade 
                 + Total_Number_Of_Gifts
                 + Total_Gift_Amount
                 + DDD 
                 + CCC 
                 + Times 
                 #+ DDDown
                 , 
                 data = df,
                 family = binomial(logit)
                )

```


*** =right

```{r warning=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
summary(my_model)
```

---

## How to use the output of the model
<br>

- # On the paper


- # Using R `predict()` function

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
prob <- predict(my_model, df, type = "response")
```
   
  - # Data set `df` should contain the exact columns used in the model

  - # Please note:
       > - ahaah
       > - ahahh

---

## How do we target people
<br>

- # Apply the coefficients on current active members we can produce the probability of a person stays with us in the future.

- # We pick out people with low probability.



---

## Accuracy of Current Model
<br>
- # Currently we can pick out 16.7% of our monthly cancellations
